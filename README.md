So basically this is a file to control an Arduino car.IR_detect, UltraSound, motor, bluetooth, and carFunction are some definition, and exe is the code that makes the car function, controlled by an app called dabble. IR: sense the lines beneath the car and determine if its black or not, and there's two detecter, so we can do some line tracking. UltraSound: for measuring distance, also consists of two detecter, it can call back how far it is between walls and the car, so we can use it to crack mazes. Motor is the function to control the car and make it move, turn, or stop. Bluetooth connects the computer to dabble and to the car while also includes functions that connect buttons to modes or car movement, basically it enables the car to run wireless-ly. CarFunction are some basic functions like linetracking, maze clearing, following, and left/right adjustment. Exe is the file that imports and sets up stuffs and runs. I guess that should be it.
